Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements from 2nd position to 4th position is 12.
