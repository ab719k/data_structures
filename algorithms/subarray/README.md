Marty and Doc don't gamble like Beef, they prefer to use stock market to multiply their fortune.
Moreover, they are proponents on investments into Hi-Tech companies and choosing undeniable champion
of the industry AT&T. We're talking about 80s here ;-)

They have stock prices for every day in historic order - oldest first. In their naive thinking
they expect to be able to buy fractions of shares at the list price on one day and sell it likewise on
another. They're not aware of commission and capital gain taxes.

Doc and Marty have $1000. They're fully aware of what happens to repetitive winners and don't want to push
their luck. For that reason they decided to cash out their premium at most once.
Stock trading system is somewhat modern and doesn't allow sell of the stocks purchased in the future.
Help Doc estimate what will be the potential pay back on this adventure.

You don't need to tell the actual plan - only profit. Stock prices will be given as decimals
on standard input - one price per line. Prices won't exceed 10<sup>6</sup>.

Example:

```
./stockGain << EOF
4.3
3.5
2.7
1.0
2.1
3.7
4.0
3.9
EOF
3000

Explanation: with their $1000, they can buy 1000 shares at $1.00 price and sell later for $4.00 per share gaining $3000.
