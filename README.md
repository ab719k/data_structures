This is an example code to demonstrate usage of cmake to build a binary which depends on the library. The Hello library implement a string concatenation from stdin/cin adding the words to a vector, and then display on the stdout/cout. The code is in C++ and Hello class is implemented. Demo.cpp creates an instance of the class and add the words to the object, and in the end display all the words on the screen.

```
cd hello_cpp
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
make
echo "This is the hello world example" >> ./Demo/helloDemo 
```
